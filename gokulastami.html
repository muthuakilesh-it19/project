<P>"Gokulashtami" or "Krishna Jayanti" or "Janmashtami" marks the celebration of the birth of Sri Krishna.<br /></p>
<P>   Gokulashtami (Lord Krishna's Birthday) was celebrated at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Ettimadai campus on<t> Tuesday, 4th September, 2007</t> with great enthusiasm and fanfare. It has always been the tradition at Amrita University to celebrate all Indian festivals in a befitting manner and this year's Gokulashtami celebrations were no exception with the entire campus wearing a festive garb.</p>
<p>   The highlight of the colourful celebrations was a procession in which more than 4000 students, staff and residents of the Amrita campus participating. Brahmachari Abhayamrita Chaitanya, Chief Operating Officer of Amrita led the procession, which included ten beautiful floats depicting various incidents in Lord Krishna’s life like Gitopadesha, Bhakta Kuchela, Kaliya Mardhana, Govardhana Giridhari etc. Children dressed up like Krishna added more colour and gaiety to the procession. The accompaniment of Bhajans with drums and other musical instruments made the entire atmosphere and procession charged with devotional fervour for Lord Krishna with students singing and dancing. The floats were conceptualized and designed by student groups in various departments and schools of Amrita University. A prize was also given to the best float, which went to the Electrical and Electronics department.</p>
<p>   Lord Sri Krishna was born on Ashtami day or the eighth day after Raksha Bandhan during the Hindu month of SHRAVAN. As the story goes he was born in the dark half of the month and at the darkest hour of midnight. But the birth of Vishnu's incarnation was to bring joy and give security to the suffering humanity.</P>
<p>   He is considered to be one of Lord Vishnu's most glorious incarnations. He is popularly known as a naughty child, an inspired cowherd, a destroyer of demons, an enthralling flute-player, a divine lover, and a clever diplomat - all rolled in one. </p>
<p>Sri Krishna is Lord Vishnu's eighth avatar (incarnation) on earth. The main object of this incarnation of Vishnu as Krishna, was to destroy the cruel King Kansa of Mathura.

Kansa, the king of Mathura was a very cruel tyrant. His tyranny spared no one, even the sages had to bear the brunt of this. Finally the Gods could tolerate no more and in a dream Kansa was told that his evil reign would be brought to an end by his sister Devaki's son who would kill him. The cowardly tyrant immediately threw his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudev in prison so that he could kill all the sons born to Devaki.

In captivity Devaki bore six sons, each of whom were promptly killed by Kansa. When Devaki gave birth to her eighth child, the newly born baby changed himself into the form of Vishnu and commanded Vasudev to carry him to Nandgaon and place him besides Yasodha. That night the prison guards fell into a deep slumber and the doors were unlocked. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Vasudev slipped out of the prison and whisked away the God-child to the safety a neighboring kingdom which was ruled by king Nanda. King Nanda's domain lay across the Yamuna river. At that time the river Yamuna was high, but when Baby Krishna's feet touched the waters , the waters parted making a channel for Vasudev to pass.

He was also asked to bring back the baby girl whom Yashoda had delivered. The generous king Nanda gave away his new born daughter to Vasudev knowing fully well what fate awaited her at Kansa's hands. Vasudev  brought back the baby girl. Seeing the baby girl, the enraged King Kansa smashed her on the wall but she escaped his hands and flew away to heaven announcing -"Beware, your killer is alive". 

At Gokul, under king Nanda's protection, Krishna got the loving affection of King Nanda's Queen Yashoda whom Krishna looked upon as a mother. Days passed with fun and frolic, while the child-Krishna grew up. Krishna grew up happy in Nandgaon amongst cowherds. His flute-playing enthralled the young girls or "gopis" who danced around him. The cows gathered with his sweet flute playing. But one day rumors reached Kansa that Devaki's son had somehow escaped his clutches and was living in Gokul. 

You will notice that the theme of "Krishna with his Gopis"  is a favorite among many Rajasthani paintings. 
Krishna was ideal in all his human relationships - a darling son to his parents, an endearing friend and comrade, a devoted disciple, a loving husband and a trusted brother. There are many stories that tell about his superhuman qualities and mystical achievements. In spite of this Sri Krishna never appeared distant to any of his fellow human beings, in fact he was dearer to them than their own nearest kith and kin.  The shadow of his greatness never marred these bonds of the heart. To the Hindu, he is the supreme statesman, warrior, hero, philosopher, teacher and god himself.</p>

<P>To encourage healthy competition and bring out the hidden potential and talents of the students, various competitions in sports, literary and cultural events were also conducted. The sports competitions included Uriadi, Pole Climbing & Tug of war. Cultural competitions were held in Vocal Music (Solo and group), Dance (Solo and group), Instrumental Music (Percussion), Skits based on Sri Krishna’s teachings, Rangoli, Painting, Clay Modeling, Gita Chanting etc. The literary competitions were in Quiz on Sri Krishna, Debate etc. Prizes were distributed to the outstanding performers.</p>
<P>Earlier in the day, the celebrations started with Sahasranama Archana followed by Nagara Sankeerthana (Sri Krishna's idol taken across the campus with stuents and staff singing the glory of the lord). For spiritual upliftment, a discourse (Satsangh) and Bhajans from evening to midnight were also conducted.</p>
<p>In the houses, mango leaves are tied to the doorways to mark the auspicious occasion. Colorful "Rangolis " are drawn on the front yard. Inside the house, a small wooden mandap is erected and decorated with flowers and plantain leaves. An idol of a crawling baby Krishna is placed in a silver cradle which is then placed in the mandap. Lord Krishna's idol is decorated with flowers and a crown and jewelry at times.

Most families keep a "vrat" or fast on this day. The fast is done all day and then one meal is had during the day. This is known as phalar, and consists of fruit, mithai, curd, (kuttu) Singhare-ki-Puri. This phalar is taken in the afternoon (around 2-3 p.m.) along with tea and coffee. During this fast, consumption of tea and coffee is not forbidden and can be taken at any time of the day.</p>
